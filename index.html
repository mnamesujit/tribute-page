                <li>MS Dhoni, popularly known as MS Dhoni, is a former Indian international cricketer and one of the
                    most
                    successful captains in the history of Indian cricket. He was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi,
                    Jharkhand, India.</li>
                <li>Dhoni is primarily known for his exceptional skills as a wicket-keeper batsman. He made his debut
                    for
                    the Indian cricket team in 2004 in an ODI match against Bangladesh. His international career spanned
                    over 15 years, during which he represented India in 90 Tests, 350 One Day Internationals (ODIs), and
                    98 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).
                </li>

                <li>Dhoni is particularly renowned for his calm and composed demeanor on the field, excellent
                    wicket-keeping skills, and his ability to finish matches with his powerful batting. He was known for
                    his unorthodox "helicopter shot," which became his trademark stroke. </li>

                <li>Under Dhoni's leadership, the Indian cricket team achieved several significant milestones. He led
                    India to victory in the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and
                    the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.</>

                <li>Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket in August 2020. His contributions to
                    Indian
                    cricket and his captaincy legacy have made him one of the most iconic figures in Indian sports
                    history. Dhoni's leadership, cool temperament, and numerous accomplishments have earned him immense
                    respect and admiration from cricket fans around the world.</li>
